# Train_program
Implementation of algorythm for train schedule.

## How it works?
1. Read train schedule from CSV-file.
2. Build an associate array to operate simpler with cycles.
3. Fill matrix with costs from array with train schedule.
4. Copy original matrix before it will be transformed by Little's algorythm.
5. Run Little's algorythm.
6. Get optimal path for the cost.

## More detailed description can be found in the code comments throughout the program.
